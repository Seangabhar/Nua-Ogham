# 1:Réamhrá
Tá an script seo bunaithe ar ogham thraidisiúnta ach ní fíor-ogham atá ann. Rinneadh an togra seo ar a mhaithe féin, ar son áilleacht an cló agus suim i dteangeolaíocht. Ní dheanann an script seo éileamh ar stair sna litríocht nó sna clocha ogham iad féin. Níl ach cosúlacht éadomhain idir an dhá rud. Ní saineolaí ar ogham é an cruthaitheoir agus rinneadh sé seo mar thogra matamaiticiúil.
# 2:Tús
De bhrí go raibh ogham úsáidte chun Sean-Ghaeilge a scríobh, tá sí go huile is go hiomlán gan mhaitheas chun Nua-Ghaeilge a scríobh. Tá cúpla consan nach úsáidtear sa Nua-Ghaeilge agus níl minicíocht na litreacha inchurtha le méid buille a n-úsáideann siad. Chomh maith leis sin, chun na gutaí fada a scríobh, tá ort dhá guta a chur in aice a chéile, nó dearúid a dheanamh air.Tá sé gan éifeacht. Is ceart go mbeadh sé úsáidte le aghaidh píosaí ealaíne beaga. Cruthadh Nua-Ogham chun an beartas sin a líonadh.
# 3:Ginearálta
Is mar sprioc ag Nua-Ogham an ogham thraidisiúnta a úsáid mar inspioráid ach leasú a dhéanamh ar chun Nua-Ghaeilge a scríobh leis sa tslí is simplí. Chun é sin a dhéanamh, bhí adharc ar cúig phointe 
1. Caithfidh cuma ogham a bheith uirthi
2. Caithfidh córas simplí a bheith aici chun gutaí fada a scríobh
3. Caithfidh córas simplí a bheith aici chun consain shéimhithe a scríobh, gan litir éigean eile.
4. Caitfidh gaol a bheith ag ord na haicmí le minicíocht na litreacha
5. Caithfidh marcanna poncaíochta a bheith aici

# 1: Foreword
This script is inspired by the traditional ogham script but it is not “authentic ogham”. This was an exercise done for its own right, for the aesthetic value of the script, and for an amateur interest in linguistics. This script does not claim any basis in classical texts or the original ogham stones themselves. There is no more than a superficial similarity between this and the original. The creator of this script is not an expert on ogham and is approaching this as a mathematical exercise and with an interest in designing an intuitive writing system based on ogham. 
# 2: Introduction to the project
While Ogham was used to write primitive Irish, it is wholly unsuitable as a writing system for modern Irish. It has several consonants that are no longer used in modern Irish. And the frequenies of some letters do not correlate with the number of strokes that they use. As well as that, to write long vowels, one must either double up on the short vowel, or ignore them altogether. It is very inefficient. Suitable for very basic aesthetic work and not much else. Nua-Ogham has been created to bridge this gap.
# 3: Overview
The purpose of Nua-Ogham is to use the traditional ogham script as a template but update it to be used with modern Irish orthography in the most efficient way possible. In doing so these 5 fundamentals were observed.
1.	It must retain the look and feel of ogham
2.	It must have an intuitive system for writing long vowels
3.	It must have an intuitive system for the inclusion of lenited consonants, without the need for a separate letter
4.	The order of each aicme should relate to the frequencies of the letters
5.	It must contain punctuation marks 

To fully illustrate the technical aspects of the script, I will split them into five sections; vowels, long vowels, un-lenitable consonants, lenitable consonants and lenited consonants. 
# 4: Vowels/ Aicme Gutaí - [a,i,e,o,u]
The design of the vowels could be considered traditional. They are a simple dot punched into the stem line. However, the order has been altered. Instead of the traditional [a,o,u,e,i] it is now [a,i,e,o,u]. This reflects their decreasing frequencies as the number of strokes is increased. 
# 5: Long Vowels/ Aicme Gutaí Fada - [á,í,é,ó,ú]
The long vowels are matched up with there corresponding short vowels in terms of stroke number. They are written with one orthogonal stroke across the stem line. It can be thought of in these terms; to write the long vowel á you take the no. strokes from the short vowel and ‘lengthen’ them into orthogonal strokes.
# 6: Unlenitable consonants / Aicme Gan Séimhiú - [n,r,l,h,z]
These are written with a diagonal stroke across the stem line. In the upright writing direction, the diagonal is written from top left to bottom right. It consists of all the consonants  which it is impossible to lenite. Some eyebrows may be raised at the inclusion of /z/ in this aicme, however this was to facilitate people who may wish to write the dialectal variation of Oileáin Cléire, which uses /z/ as an eclipsis for /s/. Although this is not found in the standard version of Irish. /h/ is included in this aicme, but at no. 4. This is because it is intended to only be written at clashing vowels, i.e na héin. If every lenition were to be counted, it is the third most common letter, however there is seperate system for lenition.
# 7: Lenitable consonants 
These are divided between two aicme. 

# 7a: Aicme ar Chlé – [t,c,d,b,p] 
These are written as orthogonal lines starting from the stem line and going left in the upright writing direction. 
    
# 7b: Aicme ar Dheis – [s,g,m,f,v]
These are written as orthogonal lines starting from the stem line and going right in the upright writing direction.  Although /v/ is not a lenitable consonant, it is             included here to maintain the maximum of five letters per aicme rather than have it in the unlenitable consonants. Therefore, there is no counterpart in the aicme sheimhithe ar dheis.
# 8: Lenited consonants
These are written with the same number strokes and in the same direction as the unlenited counterparts, however they are written diagonally so that their angle is the same as that of the unlenitable consonants. 

Once again, they are divided into two aicme

# 8a: Aicme Shéimhithe ar Chlé– [ṫ,ċ,ḋ,ḃ,ḟ]
These are written diagonally starting from the stem line and going up and left in the upright writing direction.
# 8b: Aicme Shéimhithe ar Dheis – [ṡ,ġ,ṁ,ḟ]
These are written diagonally, starting from the stem line and going down and right in the upright writing direction. This is the only aicme to have less than five members       since /v/ is included in the aicme ar dheis and cannot be lenited.
# 9: Punctuation
As well as the letters required to write modern Irish efficiently, punctuation marks have been included. It is uncertain how useful they may be, but they are included for completeness. 
The traditional end/beginning markers have also been included. These are written using the font with > and <
# 10: Reasoning
This section will explain the reasoning for the design of each aicme.

For the short vowels, the reasoning was simple. In original ogham, the vowels were written as dots, presumably to save time as they are the most common letters. Nua-Ogham merely copies this, and rearranges the order to suit modern Irish. 

For the long vowels, the reasoning for the order is thus; regardless of the relative frequency of each long vowel, they are, in absolute terms, uncommon. Therefore, it is more worthwhile to have each long vowel line up with its short vowel counterpart, rather than reorder them. The reasoning for the design is based on two things. The first is that it is intuitive, when making a vowel longer, to make the glyph itself longer. The second is that in some places, traditional ogham vowels are written as straight strokes across the stem line. This lends a familiarity to the long vowels.

For the unlenitable consonants, a diagonal line across the stem line was chosen as its would be counterpart is already used by the long vowels. The fact that unlenitable consonants need no counterparts however means that this design is the perfect choice, and leaves the rest of the paired designs untouched.

The design for the lenitable consonants was chosen for its large number of members. Between the two aicme there is ten possible letters, each with a possible diagonal variant suitable for the lenited counterparts. As there are only nine lenitable consonants, this fitted perfectly. It also left space for the inclusion of /v/ which is common in many loanwords. The reason that /v/ was placed here and /z/ in the non-lenitable is that it takes less effort to carve /v/, the more common letter.

The design for the lenited consonants was chosen to sit with aesthetic of ogham, their diagonal lines following the traditional direction. The design was also chosen because it is close to each of their lenitable counterparts, cementing the link between the sounds. The order was chosen to match up with their corresponding lenitable consonants, this being more intuitive and helpful than if they were ordered based on frequency. 

For the full stop, it was intended that this would be symbolic of one sentence ending while another began. Therefore, it is the traditional beginning and end markers linked together.

For the comma, it is intended to show that there is a new part to the sentence without the old one properly ending by using the start symbol in the middle of the text.

The question mark and exclamation mark are placeholders. 
# 11: Font
The font Ogham Nua may be used to write this script on a computer, using the normal Latin letters. Special steps need to be taken to write the lenited consonants; ṫ, ṡ, ċ, ġ, ḋ, ṁ, ḃ, ḟ, ṗ. On MS Word, this may be accomplished by assigning ALT + [dotless_letter] to each one. Do this by going to INSERT>SYMBOL>MORE SYMBOLS and selecting the desired symbol you wish to assign. Then click the SHORTCUT KEY button and assign the new shortcut by holding down the keys. Remember to do the capital versions as well and include shift in your shortcut. Alternatively insert alone can be used. If transcribing from the Latin script the find and replace tool is also very useful.
